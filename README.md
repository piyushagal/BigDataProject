Structure
  |_ HMM ( Hidden Markov Model implementation)
  |_ ANN ( Artificial neural network implementation)
  
  Both the HMM and ANN folders contains same training data and test data folders.
  
  For ANN first run the anntrainer_digits.py for training the neural network.
  Then run the main.py file, when you press record button, you can speak and anntester will display the 
  output of the  neural network.
